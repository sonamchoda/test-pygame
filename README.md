# test-pygame
Pygame Initialization:
pygame.init(): Initializes the Pygame from library.

Test Class:
TestCarGame(unittest.TestCase): Defines a test class that inherits from unittest.TestCase. This class will contain test methods.

Setup Method:
setUp(self): A method that is run before each test method. It initializes Pygame, sets up the screen, and loads car images.

Test Methods:
a. test_car_movement(self): Tests the movement of cars based on simulated keyboard presses. It initializes car positions, simulates left and right key presses, updates car positions, and asserts that the positions have changed accordingly.
b. test_car_collision(self): Tests collision detection between two cars. It initializes car positions, simulates car movement, checks for collision, and prints a game over message if a collision is detected.

Main Block:
if __name__ == "__main__":: This block ensures that the tests are executed only when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module.

Running Tests:
unittest.main(): This command runs the tests in the script when executed directly.
Note: The code assumes that there is a module named cargame with a mixer attribute, which is not included in the provided code. Make sure to include or import the necessary modules for the complete functionality.
